DNS and Route53 Setup

=====================================
Vueocity root site

    See current Vueocity AWS config


=====================================
Provider root SSL DNS setup  (to host https://provider.com)

This allows a provider to host HTTPS sandboxes under their own URL, such as

    provider.com
    customer.provider.com

This requires a separate certificate loaded to ELB listner sharing the autoscale group
to terminate SSL at ELB. Current limit is 25.
Thus this is unlikely to be used in prodution, and if it is, will require some manaul
administration.

The follwoing has to be setup manaually:

    - The URL and SSL certificate (root and wildcard for sandboxes) has
    to be registerd (registrar presumeably managed by customer)

    - A hosted zone must be created for the URL

    - The customer's DNS must point to to the Amazon hosted zone

    - The SSL certs must be uploaded (via ELB listener UI)

    - Root and wildcard aliases in Route53 need to be setup to new ELB

    - SES validation needs to be setup for email address to send from,
    requires TXT record on the customer DNS

    - Sandbox URLs need to be updated appropriately
