See AwsSetup.txt for discussion of SSH keys for access to AWS
Using AWS Certificate Manager, which became available in 2017,
some notes below only apply to external key creation.


=====================================
SSH Keys

Key pairs can be generated in the AWS EC2 control panel, with a one-time
download of the private key.

Generate in EC2 or Windows PowerShell:

    > ssh-keygen
    or
    > ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "user@acme.com"

    Define file name for private key, public key will have .pub extension.
    Windows assumes .ssh folder under users
    AWS clients assume 'id_rsa' and 'id_rsa.pub' default names in that folder.

Or create private and public EC2
    > openssl genrsa -out private2048.pem 2048
    > openssl rsa -in private2048.pem -pubout

=====================================
Adding SSL to ELB

    - Add SSL certificates to listeners
	- Certificate provider to AWS term conversion file conventions:

        xxx.key === Private Key (AWS), the key used to generate the csr request
		primary.crt === Public Key Certificate (AWS) === End Entity Certificate === ssl_certificate
		chain.crt === Certificate Chain (AWS) === Primary (crossRootCA) AND Secondary (intermediateCA) certificate

		FOR AWS chain.crt, NEED TO PLACE SECONDARY AT TOP, AND PRIMARY AT BOTTOM!

=====================================
SSL Notes

    - Assumption is terminate at ELB
    - AWS calls ELB SSL certificates "server certificates"
    - Nginx termination requires cert in AMI instance or via cert manager API; don't plan to use
	- Files are stored under by convention under:  [root]\deploy\certs\cert_name
	- For AWS, want X.509 (Apache) certifiate type (vs. MS PKCS)
	- MUST USE CERTIFICATE CHAIN
	  It is documented many places as optional, but FireFox stopped accepting
	  certificates without chains.

Can access Cloudfront SSL certificates from North Virginia region.
To do it via command line:

    aws iam upload-server-certificate --server-certificate-name NAME --certificate-body file://../primary.crt --private-key file://../PRIVATE_KEY.pem --certificate-chain file://../chain.crt --path /cloudfront/xyz/


=====================================
Creating SSL certificates

To generate a key for registration  (named prod2048.crt)

    > openssl req -new -key private2048.pem -out prod2048.csr
    - Answer questions -- remember they will be validated by SSL provider
    - Take csr and register it with an SSL provider to get a crt back
    - Encrypt private file with pwd before storing

To generate a self-signed dev key

    > openssl genrsa -out dev1024.pem 1024
    > openssl req -new -key dev1024.pem -out dev1024.csr
    - Answer questions
    > openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in dev1024.csr -signkey dev1024.pem -out dev1024.crt
