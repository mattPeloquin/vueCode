Paypal Notes

PayPal is used with the Vueocity root account to make transactions on behalf of providers
using their PayPal ID.

Don't want to manage provider's account pwd, so can't do transactions directly
with their accounts.


Log into developer site with normal account credentials

https://developer.paypal.com/


Sandbox accounts - password:  paytest11

mattp-facilitator@vueocity.com
mattp-buyer@vueocity.com
user@acme.com
staff@provider1.com

mattp@vueocity.com - this is weird from original; won't let me delete

Look at profile for each sandbox account to get the URL credentials.

NEVER GOT SANDBOX TO WORK

NVP Express checkout URLs:

This works for normal selling, but the API never correctly applied recurring payments,
so has not worked for setting up subscriptions.
Maybe not being authorized correctly via email, etc?

Next step is to implement REST API, where hopefully subscriptions / pre-approvied payments
can be setup on behalf of other accounts.
