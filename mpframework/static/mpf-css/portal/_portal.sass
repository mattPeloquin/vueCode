    CSS elements designed for EasyStyle override of most of the UI without
    side effects. These are placed throughout the with the class prefix:

        es_xxx
        es_theme_xxx

    Many EasyStyle items define default MPF look and feel, but
    some are simply hooks (and may or may not be defined here).
