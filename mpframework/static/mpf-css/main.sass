    Main styling for elements is included here

    Use the following guidelines for CSS development:

        - Keep DRY with sass
        - CSS inheritance rules are ridiculous; keep CSS simple
        - Use Javascript fixup code as a last resort, or to simplify CSS
        - Use the element inspector debug tools to see what is going on
        - Be careful with open class selectors that have to be scanned in DOM

        - Prefer em over px for spacing, to take advantage of scaling to font size
        - Newer browsers can scale px, so many historical concerns about px not relevant
        - Use mix of % and px for font sizing: careful with cumulative em and % effect on font-sizing

        - z-index only works when position: has been set
